# Why?
Already build a high performance and high throughput log system, so want try to build a db system.

# [godis](http://godis.io)
Tried to write a redis in golang, but have very low preformance in `SET` and `GET`, maybe there have more optimizable space, need a lot time to think.

# Want
Using golang! And build a DB like database.

# Todo
[] Read the sqlite source code
[] Enhance the godis
